                40,000Kgs at deflections ranging upto 10 degrees. The Torsional test determines the strength of
                the bond of the rubber. Similarly the conical test applies load in the conical plane to ensure the
                required stiffness of the rubber compound.
                The components are tested for radial & compressive loads upto 40 Tonnes alongwith pre loads
